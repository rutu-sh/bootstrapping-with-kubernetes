# Introduction

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) has been **THE** go-to solution for orchestrating workloads as it has established its acceptance due to its elegant design and commendable performance. This book is intended for those who wish to learn Kubernetes from scratch, understand its concepts, and use it with other open source tools to build scalable applications.

There are plethora of resources and articles available online to learn Kubernetes. Honestly, I haven't found one that gives a consistent and comprehensive explanation of the underlying concepts and how to use them with other tools. This book is an attempt to fill that gap.
