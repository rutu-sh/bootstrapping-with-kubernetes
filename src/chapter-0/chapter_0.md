# Introduction

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) has been **THE** go-to solution for orchestrating workloads as it has established its acceptance due to its elegant design and commendable performance. This book is intended for those who wish to learn Kubernetes from scratch, understand its concepts, and use it with other open source tools to build scalable applications.

There are plethora of resources and articles available online to learn Kubernetes. Honestly, I haven't found one that gives a consistent and comprehensive explanation of the underlying concepts and how to use them with other tools. This book is an attempt to fill that gap. This book will distinguish itself by providing a hands-on approach to getting into the Kubernetes ecosystem. 

The supplementary code for this book is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rutu-sh/bootstrapping-with-kubernetes-examples).

## Thanks to Cloudlab

A part of this book is developed as a part of my work at GWU, I owe a huge thanks to [Cloudlab](https://cloudlab.io/) for providing the platform to test the examples in this book. Everything in this book, or any other version of this book will hence be available for free and open source, now and in future. Anyone can use the code and examples in this book for their learning and development. This book is a humble attempt to give back to the community and help others learn Kubernetes. Cloudlab has been a great platform for me to learn and experiment with Kubernetes and a lot of other technologies. I hope my experimentations and learnings will help others in making their contributions to the community.
