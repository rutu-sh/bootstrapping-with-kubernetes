# Bootstrapping with Kubernetes

This book is an effort to share my knowledge in Kubernetes with the community. I have been working with Kubernetes for quite a while now, but only recently did I start exploring it in depth. I have always known HOW to use Kubernetes, but never really understood WHY things work the way they do. Though I have found plenty of resources to learn Kubernetes in and out, it has always been so scattered. Through this book I aim to provide a comprehensive guide to Kubernetes, by taking a backwards learning approach, showing you how to do things and then explaining what makes them work. At the time or writing, I myself am still at a shallow understanding of Kubernetes. You'll find this book to be a journey of learning Kubernetes with me. You won't need a setup to follow along, as I will make sure to provide outputs and examples for every command I run. 

Another motive for covering the depths of Kubernetes is to promote research and development in the field. From experience, I know that getting started with Kubernetes is quite a challenge. Through this book, I aim to make it easier for everyone, especially researchers who also spend time exploring plethora of other technologies. I hope this book will help you get started with Kubernetes and make your journey a little less challenging. 

While writing this book, I have a simple thought in mind: 

> Beneath everything and every abstraction, there is a simple linux machine doing the work, where everything is either a file or a process.

Keeping this thought in mind, I will try my best to elaborate Kubernetes as a function of basic linux concepts. 

**TLDR:** I'll try my best to help you appreciate the beauty of Kubernetes.
