# Quick Recap

Here are the key concepts we have learned so far:

---
## Cluster and Kubernetes

A cluster is a group of machines that work together. 

Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that helps manage these machines.

## Nodes 

A node is simply a machine.

## Pods 

A pod runs one or more containers.

## Services

A service is a way to expose an application running in a pod to the outside world.

## Replica Sets

Replica Sets manage the number of replicas of a pod running at any given time.

## Deployments

Deployments control the Replica Sets, allowing versioning and scaling of applications.

Now let's understand the architecture of Kubernetes.
