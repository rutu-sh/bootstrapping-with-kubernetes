# Concepts

We cover the basic concepts of Kubernetes in this chapter. 

Familiarizing ourselves with what a cluster is, we then dwell into the architecture of Kubernetes. A basic understanding of the architecture is essential if you truly want to appreciate the beauty of Kubernetes. With this knowledge, we can easily understand what happens in the background when we interact with Kubernetes. 

Before going ahead with the architecture, we'll first cover some basic concepts like Nodes, Pods, Services, Deployments, and more. These are important for understanding the underlying architecture of Kubernetes.

For me, at the beginning, understanding these concepts was a bit overwhelming. If you feel the same, don't worry, the rest of the book will help you utilize these concepts in practical settings.
